# pose-estimation-exploratory-project
This is an experiment to work on estimating pose from an image, and then extend the work further on videos. Will continue to work on trying and building better models. I have faced a few roadblocks, but I will get everything working soon.       

### Dataset 1    
The dataset that I worked on for pose estimation:        
1) https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-2018     

To learn more on image segmentation I am taking baby steps.

I have started working on spartialtemporal data and I am trying to classify images.
